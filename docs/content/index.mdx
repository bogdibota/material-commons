## Vision
**tl;dr:** Boilerplate is never good => we did it for you.

Creating forms and tables was always a job full of boilerplate code. This is not only impractical and tedious to do, but it can generate a lot of bugs.
To add on top, every new addition (like adding error management) has to be implemented over and over again. Also bugs. A lot of time can be lost with bugs.

Of course you can improve this with nice reusable components or HOCs, but we already did that for you.


## Solution
**tl;dr:** Declare stuff => stuff works.

Instead of writing copious amounts of code, how about only writing the actual essence of your requirement.
You won't have to write complicated components and handle issues such as validation and error management because they are already built in.

Now imagine how fast you could develop when you only have to ask for what you want, not implement it.

## Examples

A minimal set of examples to show you how easy your life can be.

### Form example

More details about forms [here](/form).

    { name: 'password', label: 'Password', type: 'password' },
  ] }
  onSubmit={ handleLogin }
/>
```

### Table example

<DVKTable
  columns={ [
    { name: 'id', label: 'Id', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'firstName', label: 'First Name', type: 'text' },
    { name: 'lastName', label: 'Last Name', type: 'text' },
  ] }
  rows={ [
    { id: 1, firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" },
    { id: 2, firstName: "Jane", lastName: "Doe" },
    { id: 3, firstName: "John", lastName: "Roe" },
    { id: 4, firstName: "Richard", lastName: "Roe" },
  ] }
/>
